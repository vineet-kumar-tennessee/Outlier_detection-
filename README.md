# Outlier Detection using Various Methods

This repository contains a Python script for detecting univariate and multivariate outliers using several methods. The script uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Methods Implemented

### Univariate Outlier Detection
1. **Z-score (Standard Score)**
2. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**
3. **Modified Z-score**

### Multivariate Outlier Detection
1. **Isolation Forest**
2. **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
3. **K-means Clustering**
4. **Angle-based Outlier Detection (ABOD)**

## Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pyod

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn pyod
